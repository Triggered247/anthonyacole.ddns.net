    <h2>About Me</h2>

      <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>
        I was born in 1995 in Robbinsdale, MN and have grown up in the suburbs of Minneapolis my entire life. After moving around a bit, my family settled in the town of Osseo where I attended grades 6-12.
        I graduated from Osseo Senior High School in 2013 with honors and a GPA of 3.2. I started working at 16 years old at a Holiday Gas Station.
        I worked there for about 2 years before deciding I wanted to try something different. I decided to give the service industry a try as I found myself accepting a job to be a busser at Benihana.
        I really enjoyed bussing as it was a nice mixture of customer interaction and physical labor. After about a year, I was interested in moving up in the company so I decided to give being a Server a try.
        I found being a Server to be much more difficult than anticipated. The large number of customers that I had to service in a day was extremely exhausting. I started to become bitter and anti-social from the interactions I had with some customers so I decided it was time to move on having given it a shot for a full year.
        </p>

        <p>
        I decided to try applying to more 'blue collar' jobs such as construction, furniture moving, and painting. I ended up applying to a sewer cleaning company that was offering great pay with no experience necessary. After the interview, I was offered the job and took it happily. I was excited to try something I had never done or seen before.
        The first year at the company was a blast. I absolutely loved my boss, the owner of the company, and I was able to find a nice mixture of customer interaction and physical labor once again. After about 5 years working for the company, the owner decided that we had grown enough to need a Supervisor position. The guy who trained me initially took the position but didn't last long due to personal issues he was having. Once the Supervisor role opened up, I told my boss I would be interested in fulfilling the position.
        After I was offered the Supervisor position, I embraced the expectations and tried my best to be a good Supervisor. During the last 5 years at the sewer company, I had the opportunity to train numerous new hires and meet some pretty awesome people. I thoroughly enjoyed my time at the company, but I decided it was time to move to an industry that was more gentle on my body.
        </p>

        <p>
        I have always had a facination with computers most of my life. This has stemmed from a life time of playing video games on various platforms over the years. Once I got into playing video games on a PC, I started to really get interested in how video games were made.
        Utilizing my curiousity about the development of video games, I decided to start attending college with a declared major of Computer Science.

      <h3>Education</h3>
        <p>I am currently studying Computer Science at North Hennepin Community College. I expect to graduate in the spring of 2026 with an AS in Computer Science.
        After graduating with my AS, I plan on attending Metro State University in persuing a BS in Cybersecurity.
