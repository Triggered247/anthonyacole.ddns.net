    About Me
    </h2>

      <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>
        I was born in 1995 in Robbinsdale, MN and have grown up in the suburbs of Minneapolis my entire life. After moving around a bit, my family settled in the town of Osseo where I attended grades 6-12.
        I graduated from Osseo Senior High School in 2013 with honors and a GPA of 3.2. I started working at 16 years old at a Holiday Gas Station.
        I worked there for about 2 years before deciding I wanted to try something different. I decided to give the service industry a try as I found myself accepting a job to be a busser at Benihana.
        I really enjoyed bussing as it was a nice mixture of customer interaction and physical labor. After about a year, I was interested in moving up in the company so I decided to give being a Server a try.
        I found being a Server to be much more difficult than anticipated. The large number of customers that I had to service in a day was extremely exhausting. I started to become bitter and anti-social from the interactions I had with some customers so I decided it was time to move on having given it a shot for a full year.
        </p>

        <p>
        I decided to try applying to more 'blue collar' jobs such as construction, furniture moving, and painting. I ended up applying to a sewer cleaning company that was offering great pay with no experience necessary. After the interview, I was offered the job and took it happily. I was excited to try something I had never done or seen before.
        The first year at the company was a blast. I absolutely loved my boss, the owner of the company, and I was able to find a nice mixture of customer interaction and physical labor once again. After about 5 years working for the company, the owner decided that we had grown enough to need a Supervisor position. The guy who trained me initially took the position but didn't last long due to personal issues he was having. Once the Supervisor role opened up, I told my boss I would be interested in fulfilling the position.
        After I was offered the Supervisor position, I accepted the position. In my role as Supervisor, I was tasked with assisting the other technicians when they encountered a situation they could not resolve as well as other tasks given to me by the owner.
        I had numerous other tasks that I was responsible for completing, such as repairing equipment, creating the schedules for the technicians, assisting the owner with his tasks, and completing invantory checks that I would report to the owner so he could order the respective parts.
        When ever a technician encountered equipment that was faulty or broken, I was tasked with attempting to repair it. This consisted of welding metal cables, wiring GFCI outlets, and even light automotive work.
        During the last 5 years at the sewer company, I had the opportunity to train numerous new hires and meet some pretty awesome people. I thoroughly enjoyed my time at the company, but I decided it was time to move to an industry that was more gentle on my body.

        <p>
        I have always had a facination with computers most of my life. This has stemmed from a life time of playing video games on various platforms over the years. Once I got into playing video games on a PC, I started to really get interested in how video games were made.
        Utilizing my curiousity about the development of video games, I decided to start attending college with a declared major of Computer Science. This allowed me to learn all of the basics of how a computer functions along with a few programming languages.
        While learning about Computer Science, I found a course about Cybersecurity on the Coursera website and I decided to enroll. After completing the course and earning the certificate, I had a new interest in the Cybersecurity field. I did some research and found a couple websites that help in teaching Cybersecurity concepts.
        These websites are <a href="https://tryhackme.com/">TryHackMe.com</a> and <a href="https://www.hackthebox.com/">HackTheBox.com</a>. I have enjoyed learning and practicing Cybersecurity skills and have decided to persue a career in Cybersecurity. More specifically, I would like to learn Penetration-Testing skills and I would like to ultimately work in an Security Operations Center.
        </p> 

      <h3>Education</h3>
        <p>
        I am currently studying Computer Science at North Hennepin Community College(NHCC). During my time at NHCC, I have taken some core Computer Science courses that have taught me numerous topics. 
        Some topics include, Java programming, Python programming, SQL, and Database modeling and design. I have also taken an intro course into the Linux operating system. During these classes, I was exposed to useful tools such as IntelliJ IDE, VirtualBox virtual machine software, and MySQLServer.
        Shortly after starting my journey in college, I was watching Youtube videos about Cybersecurity. I came across videos from the Coursera website that talked a lot about the Cybersecurity fundamentals. I ended up watching the entire series which prompted me to enroll in the Google Cybersecurity course on the Coursera website. I completed the course and earned my certificate in 09/2024.
        I have one semester left of college (as of 07/2025) until I have completed all the requirements for an AS degree in Computer Science. During this last sememster, I will learn about computer architecture and the C/C++ programming language.
        I expect to graduate in the spring of 2026 and (as of 07/2025) I currently hold a 3.73 GPA and I am also a member of the Phi Theta Cappa Honor Society.
        After graduating with my AS, I plan on attending Metro State University in persuing a BS and possibly a MS in Cybersecurity.

    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <div class="project">
      <h3>
      <img src="RaspberryPi_Logo.png" style="float:right;width:150px" alt="RaspberryPi Logo"/>
      Hosting this website on a RaspberryPi
      </h3>
      <p>
      I decided to start this project as an introduction into server administration and web development. I got the idea to host a personal web server while I was playing around with the VirtualBox software.
      I started this project with no real background knowledge on web development, but since I had taken an Intro to Linux class, I felt that I would be able to figure out how to host a web server on a RaspberryPi since Raspbian OS is derived from the Debian Linux distribution.
      I have a little self-taught knowledge in HTML that I learned from the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com">w3schools.com</a> website. I used this, along with the Microsoft CoPilot AI software to help develop the HTML code for this website. 
      </p>
      
      <p>
      This website is currently the only project I am working on, but I plan on working on more in the future. I have not decided on the exact project yet, but a few ideas I have been thinking about are: Hosting a VPN, creating a personal cloud storage, or maybe even creating a retro gaming device. All of these can be done using the RaspberryPi that I have purchased.
